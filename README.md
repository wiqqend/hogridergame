# project overview:
# Our project is a platformer where your main objective is to collect coins and progress over distance, ChatGPT was used to assist in our development. The <style> (css) section was made by jamie to customize our goofy looking project, while jacob (me) mainly did the movement (and a failed attempt at making goblin enemies), we both worked to make all of the audio components and the rainbow sky, We also both worked on the HTML part of the code and we both made the menu together, Chat mainly handled the javascript behind everything.
